		Description: "The Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) of the certificate used in this site does not match the actual name of the site.

                    the software is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data is
                    not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the
                    Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be
                    possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with
                    a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order
                    to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain
                    to the site that is being accessed.`,

		Summary:       "Untrusted Certificate Authority",
		Description:   "The certificate used in this site is issued by either an invalid or an untrusted Certificate Authority (CA). This could mean that the certificate is self-signed or that is issued by a CA that is not widely trusted.",
		Score:         report.SeverityThresholdMedium,
