# Custom Templates

Templates created in this directory will be added to the [default Nuclei templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/) when building the check. Templates in this directory should follow the same directory structure as in the original Nuclei project.

Custom templates in the same location and with the same name will replace the default Nuclei templates in the check. This can be used to perform modifications to the original Nuclei templates where necessary.
