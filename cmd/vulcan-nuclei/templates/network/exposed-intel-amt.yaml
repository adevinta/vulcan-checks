info:
  name: Exposed Intel AMT
  author: Adevinta
  severity: high
  description: The port is comonly used by Intel AMT, which allows remote computer management from the network. If Intel AMT is enabled and exposed to a network, an attacker from that network can exploit it to gain complete access to a vulnerable machine. In some cases, an attacker might be able to gain access without a vulnerability being present by bruteforcing administrative credentials or using default ones. Restrict network access to it.
