## Building and testing

This project is primarily built using the [vulcan-checks-bsys](https://github.com/adevinta/vulcan-checks-bsys) project.

But it's possible to build each one of the checks with `go build`.

In every check directory there is an example configuration file called `local.toml.example`, most checks reads a
file named `local.toml` if you pass the `-t` parameter, so by copying that file you can do a local test of your code
before you commit.

The checks that are not self-contained, and instead rely on external binaries, can be locally tested with
`vulcan-checks-bsys`. By running `vulcan-build-images -r PATH_TO_THE_CHECK_DIR` it will create a docker image and
run it, feeding the check with the input from local.toml.

Full example to build and test run one check:

```sh
cd cmd/vulcan-drupal
go build
cp local.toml.example local.toml
./vulcan-drupal -t
```

If you are running go version 1.17 or later, you can easily use the build system project with `go run`:

```sh
cd cmd/vulcan-drupal
go run github.com/adevinta/vulcan-checks-bsys/cmd/vulcan-build-images@master -r ../vulcan-drupal
```

For older versions of go you should use `go install` or `go get`, depending on version.
